## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LispCompiler.git
   cd LispCompiler
   ```

2. Ensure you have Ruby installed on your system. You can check by running:
   ```bash
   ruby --version
   ```

3. No additional dependencies are required.

## 🚀 Usage

Run the Lisp interpreter by executing the `Compiler.rb` file:

```bash
ruby Compiler.rb
```

### Example Usage

You can test the following Lisp expressions directly in the code:

```lisp
(+ 5 3)               ; Adds 5 and 3, output: 8
(- 10 4)              ; Subtracts 4 from 10, output: 6
(* 2 6)               ; Multiplies 2 and 6, output: 12
(/ 8 2)               ; Divides 8 by 2, output: 4
(max 1 5 3)           ; Finds the maximum, output: 5
(list 1 2 3)          ; Creates a list, output: [1, 2, 3]
(def x 10)            ; Defines a variable `x` with value 10
(if (> x 5) x 0)      ; Conditional expression, output: 10
(print "Hello, World!") ; Prints "Hello, World!"
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

To test the program, you can modify the `Compiler.rb` file to include additional Lisp expressions or write a test suite to automate the evaluation of expressions.
